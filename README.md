A small Python project made for fun that I will use to help me better understand how the classic machine learning algorithms work by implementing them from scratch. 

Currently implemented:
1. Linear Regression using Normal Equation (single and multiple features)
2. Linear Regression using Gradient Descent (single and multiple features)
3. Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent (single and multiple features)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (regression and binary classification)
